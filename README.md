Quimical is an application designed to help high school students who are preparing for the Enem exam. 
Within the app, the user will find the chemistry content that appears most often in the Enem exam and within each content there is a timer inspired by the pomodoro technique. 
 
 
It is also possible to enter the Enem exams taken by the user, and finally the application returns the history of exams and pomodoros taken.
